# Potato Disease Classification

This is a potato disease classification web app made using **TensorFlow** and **Keras' Sequential API**. It needs jpg image of a potato leaf and using Convolutional Neural Networks it predicts if the plant has:

- Early Blight
- Late Blight
- No Disease (Healthy)


##  🔨 Model Architecture
The model is as shown below:

## ⏳ Training
The model is trained on the dataset taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

In addition to the following dataset, data-augmentation was also performed to significantly increase the diversity of data available.

## 🚀 Deployment
The web app is deployed using **StreamLit** and **Heroku**. Here is the link to the app:
